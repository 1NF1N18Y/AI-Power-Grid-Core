Wallet
------

- A new `listdescriptors` RPC is available to inspect the contents of descriptor-enabled wallets.
  The RPC returns public versions of all imported descriptors, including their timestamp and flags.
  For ranged descriptors, it also returns the range boundaries and the next index to generate addresses from. (dash#5911)
